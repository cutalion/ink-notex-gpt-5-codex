# CLI Todo App Requirements

## Overview
Create a beautiful, professional CLI todo application that feels modern and responsive. Users should be able to manage their todos efficiently through keyboard navigation with a polished, visually appealing interface.

## Core Functionality

### Essential Features
- **Add todos**: Quick and easy todo creation
- **View todos**: See all todos with current status
- **Edit todos**: Modify existing todo text
- **Complete/Uncomplete todos**: Toggle completion status
- **Delete todos**: Remove todos permanently
- **Undo/Redo functionality**: Comprehensive history tracking with ability to undo and redo all actions
- **Settings management**: Configure storage preferences and application behavior
- **Help system**: Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts reference accessible on-demand
- **Persistent storage**: Todos survive app restarts with flexible storage options
- **Keyboard navigation**: Fast, efficient navigation without mouse
- **Safe exit handling**: Double Ctrl+C confirmation prevents accidental quits

### User Workflows

#### First-time User Experience
1. User runs the app and sees an empty state with clear guidance
2. Helpful message explains how to add their first todo
3. Interface shows available commands/shortcuts

#### Daily Usage Patterns  
1. **Quick todo entry**: User can rapidly add multiple todos without friction
2. **Review and triage**: User can navigate through todos, checking off completed items
3. **Editing**: User can easily fix typos or update todo text
4. **Error recovery**: User can undo accidental deletions or modifications using keyboard shortcuts
5. **Settings adjustment**: User can switch storage locations based on context (project vs global)
6. **Cleanup**: User can delete completed or unwanted todos

#### Productivity Scenarios
- **Morning planning**: Adding several todos for the day
- **Task completion**: Checking off items as work progresses  
- **Evening review**: Editing remaining todos, deleting completed ones
- **Mistake recovery**: Using undo/redo to quickly recover from accidental changes
- **Project work**: Switching to local storage for project-specific todos
- **Context switching**: Quickly jumping between different todos and storage contexts

## User Experience Requirements

### Visual Design Expectations
- **Professional appearance**: Clean, modern interface that looks polished
- **Clear visual hierarchy**: Easy to distinguish between different types of information
- **Status indication**: Clear visual difference between completed and pending todos
- **Selection feedback**: User always knows which item is currently selected
- **Consistent styling**: Cohesive color scheme and typography throughout

### Interaction Design
- **Keyboard-first**: All functionality accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- **Intuitive shortcuts**: Standard keyboard conventions (arrow keys for navigation, Enter for actions, dedicated undo/redo keys)
- **Safe exit patterns**: Double Ctrl+C confirmation with timeout prevents accidental exits
- **Immediate feedback**: Actions should feel responsive with instant visual updates
- **Error recovery**: Comprehensive undo/redo system allows users to easily recover from mistakes
- **Error prevention**: Interface should guide users and prevent invalid actions
- **Helpful guidance**: Dedicated help screen with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts and clean status line showing essential commands

### Information Architecture
- **Essential info prominently displayed**: Todo text is the primary focus
- **Supplementary details available**: Creation/completion timestamps for reference
- **Status overview**: Summary statistics help users understand their progress
- **History awareness**: Undo/redo availability clearly indicated in the interface
- **Context awareness**: Current storage location and settings always visible with clean, minimal paths
- **Smart organization**: Completed items visually distinguished but still accessible
- **Exit feedback**: Clear confirmation messages for exit attempts at bottom of interface

## Functional Requirements

### Todo Management
- Each todo has text content and completion status
- Todos are created with timestamps
- Completion timestamps recorded when items are marked done
- Todos can be edited after creation
- Todos can be deleted permanently
- All todo operations are tracked in history for undo/redo functionality

### Navigation & Selection
- User can navigate through todos using arrow keys
- Current selection is always clearly visible
- Navigation wraps appropriately (or handles boundaries gracefully)
- Selection state persists during mode changes when possible

### Text Input & Editing
- Rich text input experience for adding new todos
- Editing existing todos feels natural and responsive
- Standard text editing shortcuts work as expected
- Cursor position is visible during text entry
- Input validation prevents empty or invalid todos

### Data Persistence & Storage Management
- All todos are automatically saved
- Data persists between app sessions
- No manual save action required
- **Flexible storage locations**: Users can choose between global and project-specific storage
- **Intelligent defaults**: App automatically detects and uses most appropriate storage location
- **Seamless switching**: Users can change storage location without data loss or app restart
- **History persistence**: Undo/redo history is maintained across storage location switches
- Graceful handling of storage errors

### Terminal Responsiveness
- Interface adapts to different terminal sizes
- Large numbers of todos handled gracefully (scrolling)
- Performance remains good with many items
- Works reasonably in small terminal windows

## User Interface Behavior

### View Mode (Default State)
- Shows list of all todos with clear status indicators
- Displays helpful statistics (total count, completed count, etc.)
- Shows context-appropriate help text
- Selected item is highlighted
- Empty state provides clear guidance for first-time users

### Add Mode
- Dedicated interface for entering new todo text
- Real-time text input with visible cursor
- Submit action adds todo and allows quick addition of more
- Cancel action returns to viewing todos
- Text editing shortcuts work naturally

### Edit Mode
- Similar to add mode but pre-populated with existing todo text
- Cursor positioned appropriately for editing
- Save action updates the todo and returns to view mode  
- Cancel action discards changes

### Settings Mode
- Dedicated interface for configuring application preferences
- Clear presentation of available storage options with descriptions
- Visual indicators for current and selected settings
- Immediate preview of setting changes
- Easy navigation and selection with keyboard shortcuts
- Non-destructive - user can cancel without losing data

### Large Lists
- Scrolling interface when todos don't fit on screen
- Clear indicators when there are more items above/below
- Selected item stays visible during navigation
- Smooth scrolling behavior

## Quality Standards

### Performance Expectations
- Instant response to keyboard input
- Smooth animations/transitions where applicable
- No noticeable lag with reasonable numbers of todos (hundreds)
- Quick startup time

### Reliability Requirements
- No data loss under normal operation
- Graceful handling of unexpected situations
- Stable performance across different terminal environments
- Consistent behavior between sessions

### Usability Goals
- New users can accomplish basic tasks without documentation
- Experienced users can work efficiently with muscle memory
- Interface feels predictable and follows established conventions
- Error states are informative and recoverable

### Polish Level
- Professional appearance suitable for daily use
- Consistent visual language throughout
- Thoughtful micro-interactions and feedback
- Feels like a commercial-quality application

## Success Criteria
The completed application should feel like a tool that users would want to use daily for managing their todos. It should be fast, reliable, and pleasant to interact with, competing favorably with other productivity tools in terms of user experience despite being text-based.
